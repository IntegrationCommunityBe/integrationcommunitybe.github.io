## About Belgian Integration Community

The Belgian Integration User group is a user group that has 4 gatherings per year where we invite speakers (local and international) to present and share their knowledge and experience on Integration technologies of the Microsoft platform.  Sessions can be focused on (new) technical content, but can also be on best practices or on sharing experiences of projects.

We constantly search for topics and speakers and are very open to the subjects, as long as they relate to Microsoft Integration.  However, we want to avoid commercial sessions, as we are an independent user group.

## Microsoft Azure?

The Microsoft Azure platform is a flexible cloud–computing platform that lets you focus on solving business problems and addressing customer needs. No need to invest upfront on expensive infrastructure. Pay only for what you use, scale up when you need capacity and pull it back when you don’t.
