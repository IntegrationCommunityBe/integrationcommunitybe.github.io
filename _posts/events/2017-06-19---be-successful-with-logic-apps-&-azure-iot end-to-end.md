Session 2: Sensors, data and dashboards: Azure IoT end-to-end (Martin Abbott)

Using a trusty Raspberry Pi and a bunch of sensors, this session will take the attendees on an end-to-end journey using Windows 10 IoT Core and the the IoT stack in Microsoft Azure.
The solution will build out a scenario from sensors all the way through to visualisation and insight, and provide attendees with a real experience in the world of the Internet of Things.
The Internet of Things is experiencing huge growth and the session will provide a walkthrough of the key areas that constitute a solution, providing attendees with a good starting point from which to build their own solutions.
