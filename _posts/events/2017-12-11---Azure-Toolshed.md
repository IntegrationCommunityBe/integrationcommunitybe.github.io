### Session 1: THE TOOLSHED: INSIDE MICROSOFT AZURE TOOLS: YOUR DAILY HAMMERS! (Mike Martin)

Visual Studio, MSFT’s flagship tool is available for almost every purpose now and people just love it. With it came the new release of the online version and also one for Microsoft Azure integrated in Azure App Services (“Monaco”). This doesn’t make the choice of tooling easier on all of us. And thus maybe it’s about time to take a look what we can do with all the available tools and which tools are your best tools of the trade. And is there such a thing as “One Tool to rule’em all”? This session will hopefully enlighten your path to Microsoft Azure Tooling (for Dev, IT Pro and asset Management)

SMALL NOTE: this session isn’t sponsored although it’s mostly about partner solutions! Although we mention Visual Studio, this talk is more about the 3rd party tools than it is about the Redmondian solution.Some free software may be included.
