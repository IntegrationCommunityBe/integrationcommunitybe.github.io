### Session 1: The Toolshed: Inside Microsoft Azure Tools: Your Daily Hammers! (Mike Martin)

Visual Studio, MSFT’s flagship tool is available for almost every purpose now and people just love it. With it came the new release of the online version and also one for Microsoft Azure integrated in Azure App Services (“Monaco”). This doesn’t make the choice of tooling easier on all of us. And thus maybe it’s about time to take a look what we can do with all the available tools and which tools are your best tools of the trade. And is there such a thing as “One Tool to rule’em all”? This session will hopefully enlighten your path to Microsoft Azure Tooling (for Dev, IT Pro and asset Management)

SMALL NOTE: this session isn’t sponsored although it’s mostly about partner solutions! Although we mention Visual Studio, this talk is more about the 3rd party tools than it is about the Redmondian solution.Some free software may be included.

He’s been active in the IT industry for almost 20 years and has performed almost all types of job profiles, going from coaching and leading a team to architecting and systems design and training. Today he’s primarily into the Microsoft Cloud Platform and Application Lifecycle Management. He’s not a stranger to both dev and IT Pro topics, they even call him the perfect hybrid solution. 

In January 2012 he became a crew member of AZUG, the Belgian Microsoft Azure User Group. As an active member he’s both involved in giving presentations and organizing events (like ITProceed, Techorama and Global Azure Bootcamp aka GAB). Mike is also a Microsoft Azure MVP (already awarded 4 times, since 2013, already received his Fifth in July 2017! ) and Microsoft Azure Advisor. 

Helping out in the community and introducing new & young people into the world of Microsoft and technology is also one of his passions.

### Session 2: Integrating life with cognitive services (Eldert Grootenboer)

In this session, we will see how we can get data from the real world, and use this to drive our business. Thanks to Microsoft Cognitive Services we can easily work with data from the real world, like text, images and videos. By integrating this data into our processes we can make even more engaging and better solutions.

### Session 3: Understanding Modern Integration (Tord Glad Nordahl)

Integration is getting more and more important as we start integrating systems as well as devices, how can you ensure that your framework is in the same era as your technology roadmap. And how can you sell it to the C-level organization. After this session you should have enough firepower to both understand what it requires, as well as how to sell it internally in your organization.
